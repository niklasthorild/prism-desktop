## Installation

### Windows Installer
Download the latest `PrismDesktopSetup.exe` from the Releases page. This will install the app and optionally set it to start with Windows.

### Linux Installer
Download the latest `appimage` from the Releases page. or download and run from source.  

**GNOME:** 
- make sure to install `AppIndicator and KStatusNotifierItem Support` through `Extension Manager
- Wayland: the app-toggle shortcut now uses the desktop portal when the compositor supports `org.freedesktop.portal.GlobalShortcuts` (works on KDE). GNOME still has limited global shortcut support.

### Manual / Portable
You can also download the standalone `.exe` if you prefer not to install anything. Just run it, and it will create a configuration file in the same directory.

## Running from Source

If you want to modify the code or run it manually:

1. Clone this repository.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
